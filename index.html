We used their API to provide data, and since it's shut down, everything will just throw an error, so I've removed all the pages and the site will be back again soon with some major improvements :)</p><p>The bot will also no longer be online in the time being, but new features are being developed</p><b>Thanks for all your support on the site however. We'll be back in a few days with an overhaul to the site and bot :).<br>Also, thanks to Mixerno for everything :)</b></body></html>
